# Rooster Grin Front End Dev Test

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## "What we think, we become" - Buddha

I wanted to utilize Bootstrap because I had not used it in some time. I thought
it would be a good opportunity to put it to use and flex my skills at learning
docs on the fly.

### Blockers

Unfortunately, I did face blockers while working on the project. These include:

- Reviewing Bootstrap and spending much of my time reading the docs and watching
  tutorials.
- I had difficulty cloning/forking the repo and received errors working with the
  forked repo
- Time contraints (I was on vacation with limited access to internet) and had
  limited time to complete the task working with new media formats! (That was a
  fun challenge too!)

### Fun

- I enjoyed the challenge of reading docs and finding ways to work out
  problems - although given more time, I would have liked to deliver a better
  product. In hindsight, I may have not used Bootstrap with the time
  limitations.
- One of the best things I can take away from this project is I had an
  opportunity to truly challenge my abilities as a front-end web developer and I
  have identified areas I need to improve. Thank you!
